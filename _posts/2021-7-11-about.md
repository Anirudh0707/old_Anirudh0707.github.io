My name is Anirudh B H. I recently graduated from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka Surathkal with a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I primarily work on problems in signal processing. I primarily work with image and speech signals and would also like to work on multi-modal signal based projects.
