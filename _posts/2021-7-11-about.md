My name is Anirudh Bindiganavale Harish. I am currently a Master's student at the Electrical and Computer Engineering of the University of California, Los Angeles. I primarily work on problems in signal processing, mainly image and speech signals. My aim is to combine my knowledge in the field of electronics with signal processing algorithms, to increase both their efficiency and efficacy.

Prior to coming to UCLA, I worked as a Research Intern at Microsoft Research India. I was a part of the EdgeML team, where I worked on audio processing algorithms for low computation devices. I graduated from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka Surathkal with a B.Tech degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering in 2020.
