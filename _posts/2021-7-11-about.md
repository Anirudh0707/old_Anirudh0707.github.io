# About Me
I'm a 2nd year Masters' student working in the [Visual Machines Group](https://visual.ee.ucla.edu/), UCLA, advised by [Prof. Achuta Kadambi](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/achuta-kadambi/). 


Prior to coming to UCLA, I was a Research Intern at Microsoft Research India. I was a part of the EdgeML team, where I worked on audio processing algorithms for low-computation devices. I graduated from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka Surathkal with a B.Tech degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering in 2020. During the same time, I completed my Undergraduate Thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula](https://sites.google.com/site/chandrasekharseelamantula/) at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore.
